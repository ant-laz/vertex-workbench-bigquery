    "\n",
    "This notebook offers demonstrations of different methods of querying data that is stored in BigQuery from within the JupyterLab interface of your Vertex AI Workbench instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confused ? Let's define each of these terms in case they're new to you\n",
    "\n",
    " * **BigQuery** BigQuery is a fully managed, AI-ready data platform that helps you manage and analyze your data with built-in features like machine learning, search, geospatial analysis, and business intelligence. BigQuery's serverless architecture lets you use languages like SQL and Python to answer your organization's biggest questions with zero infrastructure management.\n",
    " \n",
    " * **JupyterLab**  JupyterLab is a highly extensible, feature-rich notebook authoring application and editing environment, and is a part of Project Jupyter, a large umbrella project centered around the goal of providing tools (and standards) for interactive computing with computational notebooks.\n",
    " \n",
    " * **Vertex AI Workbench instance** Vertex AI Workbench instances are Jupyter notebook-based development environments on Google Cloud for the entire data science workflow. Vertex AI Workbench instances are prepackaged with JupyterLab. Vertex AI Workbench instances have integrations and features can make it easier to access your data, process data faster, schedule notebook runs, and more.\n",
    " \n",
    "For most of these methods, we will use a **Python JupyterLab Kernel**. In the Jupyter architecture, kernels are separate processes started by the server that run your code in different programming languages and environments.  We will use the IPython Jupyter Kernel that comes prepackaged with Vertex AI Workbench Instances. This will allow us to execute Python code in this notebook interactively.\n",
